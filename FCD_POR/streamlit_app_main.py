To build a truly adaptive chatbot, you need to move beyond simple, rule-based responses. The key is to create a system that can understand a wide range of user queries, retrieve relevant information from a knowledge base, and then synthesize that information into a coherent, unique answer. This is a practice known as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) [cite: 2.1, 3.3].

Here's how we can make your chatbot better, inspired by the principles of advanced conversational AI:

### 1. The Core of an Adaptive Chatbot

The biggest limitation of your current chatbot is that its "adaptive" logic relies on a fixed set of `if/elif` statements. If a user's question doesn't match one of those specific keywords, it falls back to a generic, random response. To make it more like a sophisticated model like Gemini, the chatbot needs to be able to:

* **Understand Intent**: Instead of just matching keywords, the chatbot should be able to infer what the user wants to know. This could be a question about a specific player's stats, a comparison between two teams, or a request for a tactical visualization.
* **Access Context**: The model needs access to the entire data file, not just a small, pre-selected portion. This allows it to answer follow-up questions and maintain conversational history. Your code already does a good job of passing the `context_data` object, which is the foundation of this.
* **Synthesize an Answer**: The chatbot should use the prompt and the retrieved data to generate a fresh, unique response every time. It shouldn't be choosing from a list of predefined answers.

### 2. A Proposed Architectural Change

To achieve this, we can modify the `GeminiChatbot` class to use a more dynamic approach for generating responses. Instead of relying on a static list of responses, we'll design a system that crafts a specific answer on the fly.

* **Dynamic Response Generation**: The `_get_api_response` method can be updated to use the full `context_data` to construct a new, detailed prompt for each query. This prompt will ask the model to act as a soccer analyst and use the provided data to answer the user's question directly.
* **Integrating Tools**: The current code simulates a web search with a pre-written response. In a more advanced version, this would be a live API call to a search tool. The code I provided already has the structure for this, so you would just need to replace the static response with a real tool call.

### 3. Practical Examples of What an Adaptive Chatbot Could Do

Here are a few examples of prompts that would work on the enhanced chatbot, demonstrating its adaptability and ability to provide relevant, data-backed insights:

* **Asking for Specific Stats**:
    * `"How has Portland's points per game trended over the last three seasons?"`
    * `"Can you compare Petar Musa's goals to his expected goals (xG)?"`
    * `"Tell me about the tactical strengths and weaknesses of FC Dallas."`

* **Asking for a Visualization**:
    * `"Show me a chart comparing the goals for and expected goals (xG) of both teams."`
    * `"Can you generate a line graph of the last 6 match results for Portland?"`

* **Simulating a Real-time Query**:
    * `"What are the latest injury reports for the game?"`
    * `"Is David Da Costa fit to play?"`

To get this kind of dynamic behavior, the chatbot needs to be able to process your query and then intelligently pull the correct data from the context to form a unique, relevant answer. The latest version of the code I provided sets up the foundation for this by properly passing the data and defining the system prompt, but to truly make it adaptive, you'd need to have the model write a response based on the data in real-time, as opposed to picking from a list.
